# 3D Land Cover Map | Ankara

I would like to share with you the map I created for Ankara using the ESRI Living World Atlas Sentinel-2 Global Land Cover dataset with an impressive 10 m resolution. In this project we will explore how to leverage this data to create incredibly detailed 3D elevation and land cover maps. To achieve this, we will leverage the ray shader package in R, a powerful tool for transforming spatial data into stunning visuals.

I learned how to make maps this way from Milos Popovic. Endless thanks to him.
